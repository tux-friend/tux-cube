# Physics Sensor Cube ESP32-TuxÂ³

This is an idea I had for some time after playing around with the ESP32 together with sensors, micropython and Phyphox. I started designing an own PCB for an ESP32-C3 chip. I want it to be as small as possible and also solar powered. The cube should be energy ,self-sufficient' and possible to use for teaching physics. 

The cube should have the following sensors:
- ...
- ...

I aim for a 35x35x35mm cube with 3D printed case. The case should be robust -- hopefully that it can fall from a building and be undamaged... Hope to be able to do this project. 

My inspiration come from the [ESP32-Picoclick-C3](https://github.com/makermoekoe/Picoclick-C3), [BQ25504 Solar Cell LiPo Charger](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/bq25504-solar-cell-lipo-charger/#product-description) and the [Wemos C3 Pico](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/c3/c3_pico.html).
